# Prodigy_Stopwatch
Project Title: Stopwatch App ⏱️

Project Description:

During my third internship task at Prodigy 🚀, I developed a Stopwatch App 🕰️ designed to elevate my skills in Android development. This project was an extensive exercise in leveraging various technologies to deliver a sophisticated and functional mobile application.

Key Technologies:

Java ☕: Utilised to implement core functionality and ensure smooth performance of the stopwatch.
XML 📜: Employed for designing a user-friendly and responsive interface that adapts across different devices.
Android Studio 🛠️: The primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for coding, debugging, and testing.
JavaScript ✨: Integrated to enrich the app with interactive features and dynamic behaviour.
Features Implemented:

Lap Recording 🏃‍♂️: Enables users to record and track lap times for detailed performance analysis.
Real-Time Time Display ⏱️: Provides accurate real-time updates of elapsed time, showing minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
Save and Share Results 💾🔗: Allows users to save their results to a file and share them via various platforms, facilitating easy access and distribution.
Objective:

The project aimed to refine my technical skills and deliver a user-centric application with practical functionalities. The stopwatch app is designed to be robust, intuitive, and efficient, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.
